msgid "The angle range of the servo is -90~90, but the angle set at the factory is random, maybe 0°, maybe 45°; if we assemble it with such an angle directly, it will lead to a chaotic state after the robot runs the code, or worse, it will cause the servo to block and burn out."
msgstr ""

#: ../python_start/py_servo_adjust.rst:6
msgid "So here we need to set all the servo angles to 0° and then install them, so that the servo angle is in the middle, no matter which direction to turn."
msgstr ""

#: ../python_start/py_servo_adjust.rst:8
msgid "To ensure that the servo has been properly set to 0°, first insert the servo arm into the servo shaft and then gently rotate the rocker arm to a different angle. This servo arm is just to allow you to clearly see that the servo is rotating."
msgstr ""

#: ../python_start/py_servo_adjust.rst:12
msgid "Now, run ``servo_zeroing.py`` in the ``example/`` folder."
msgstr ""

#: ../python_start/py_servo_adjust.rst:23
msgid "Next, plug the servo cable into the P11 port as follows, at the same time you will see the servo arm rotate to a position(This is the 0° position, which is a random location and may not be vertical or parallel.)."
msgstr ""

#: ../python_start/py_servo_adjust.rst:28
msgid "Now, remove the servo arm, ensuring the servo wire remains connected, and do not turn off the power. Then continue the assembly following the paper instructions."
msgstr ""

#: ../python_start/py_servo_adjust.rst:32
msgid "Do not unplug this servo cable before fixing it with the servo screw, you can unplug it after fixing it."
msgstr ""

#: ../python_start/py_servo_adjust.rst:33
msgid "Do not rotate the servo while it is powered on to avoid damage; if the servo shaft is not inserted at the right angle, pull the servo out and reinsert it."
msgstr ""

#: ../python_start/py_servo_adjust.rst:34
msgid "Before assembling each servo, you need to plug the servo cable into P11 and turn on the power to set its angle to 0°."
