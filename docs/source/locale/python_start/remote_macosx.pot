msgid "Note that this method does not encrypt communication between the Mac and Raspberry Pi. The communication will take place within your home or business network, so even if it's unprotected, it won't be an issue. However, if you are concerned about it, you can install a VNC application such as `VNCÂ® Viewer <https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/>`_."

If not, it doesn't matter, you can also use the SSH command to open the Raspberry Pi's Bash shell and then using the command to set up the VNC."
