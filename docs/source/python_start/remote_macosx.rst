==========================

For Mac users, accessing the Raspberry Pi desktop directly via VNC is more convenient than from the command line. You can access it via Finder by entering the set account password after enabling VNC on the Raspberry Pi side.

Note that this method does not encrypt communication between the Mac and Raspberry Pi. 
The communication will take place within your home or business network, so even if it's unprotected, it won't be an issue. 
However, if you are concerned about it, you can install a VNC application such as `VNCÂ® Viewer <https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/>`_.

Alternatively it would be handy if you could use a temporary monitor (TV), mouse and keyboard to open the Raspberry Pi desktop directly to set up VNC. 
If not, it doesn't matter, you can also use the SSH command to open the Raspberry Pi's Bash shell and then using the command to set up the VNC.

        :align: center

    Set **Encryption** to **Prefer off** and **Authentication** to **VNC password**. 
    
#. When you click the **OK** button, the password input screen is displayed. You can use the same password as the Raspberry pi password or a different password, so enter it and click **OK**.

    You are now ready to connect from your Mac. It's okay to disconnect the monitor.

**From here, it will be the operation on the Mac side.**

#. Now, select **Connect to Server** from the Finder's menu, which you can open by right-clicking.

* You can apply the SSH command to open the Raspberry Pi's Bash shell.
* Bash is the standard default shell for Linux.
* The shell itself is a command (instruction) when the user uses Unix/Linux.
* Most of what you need to do can be done through the shell.
* After setting up the Raspberry pi side, you can access the desktop of the Raspberry Pi using the **Finder** from the Mac.


#. Type ``ssh <username>@<hostname>.local`` to connect to the Raspberry Pi.

#. Set up your Raspberry Pi so that you can log in via VNC from your Mac once you have successfully logged into it. The first step is to update your operating system by running the following commands.

    .. code-block::

        sudo apt update
        sudo apt upgrade


    ``Do you want to continue? [Y/n]``, Enter ``Y`` when prompted.

    It may take some time for the update to finish. (It depends on the amount of updates at that time.)


#. Enter the following command to enable the **VNC Server**.

    .. code-block::

        sudo raspi-config

#. The following screen will be displayed. Select **Interface Options** with the arrow keys on the keyboard and press the **Enter** key.

    .. image:: img/image282.png
        :align: center

#. Then select **VNC**.

    .. image:: img/image288.png
        :align: center

#. Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to select **<Yes>** -> **<OK>** -> **<Finish>** to complete the setup.

    .. image:: img/mac_vnc8.png
        :align: center


#. Now that the VNC server has started, let's change the settings for connecting from a Mac.

    To specify parameters for all programs for all user accounts on the computer, create ``/etc/vnc/config.d/common.custom``.

    .. code-block::

        sudo nano /etc/vnc/config.d/common.custom

    After entering ``Authentication=VncAuthenter``, press ``Ctrl+X`` -> ``Y`` -> ``Enter`` to save and exit.

    .. image:: img/mac_vnc15.png
        :align: center

#. In addition, set a password for logging in via VNC from a Mac. You can use the same password as the Raspberry pi password or a different password. 


    .. code-block::

        sudo vncpasswd -service


#. Once the setup is complete, restart the Raspberry Pi to apply the changes.

    .. code-block::

        sudo sudo reboot

#. Now, select **Connect to Server** from the **Finder**'s menu, which you can open by right-clicking.

    .. image:: img/mac_vnc10.png
        :align: center

#. Type in ``vnc://<username>@<hostname>.local`` (or ``vnc://<username>@<IP address>``). After entering, click **Connect**.
