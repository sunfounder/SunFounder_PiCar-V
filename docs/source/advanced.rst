Now the car is running! You may try control it or view the image
captured in Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X.

So what to do next?

Yes, sensors! There are 8 digital and 4 analog channels on the Robot
HATS, as well as two I2C ports. Plus the 3mm slot on the acrylic plate
in the car head, it enables the connection of various sensors, making
the car smarter and more intriguing as you want!

And, coding! If you know programming and are capable of compiling code,
you may change the code provided for the kit to make the car more
fabulous. For instance, you can find the code that controls the front
and back wheels in the folder SunFounder_PiCar, downloaded to the
directory /home/pi if you've installed the program by
install-dependences.

You may check what's in the file:

.. raw:: html

    <run></run>

.. code-block:: 

    cd ~/SunFounder_PiCar
    ls

After you've changed the code, you can go to the page of the Github
repository for the car, and fork it to help improve it! Also you're
quite welcome to post issues and request a pull on our Github page:
